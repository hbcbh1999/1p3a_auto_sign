1point3acres.com forum auto sign script

## What you need: 
* Python3
* Chrome && chromedriver
* Selenium
* Linux (Use raspberry pi 4 for demo)

## What it can do for you: 
Auto sign for you once a day to get forum point, and send the result to your email, 
so you would know your total wealth :dog:

This script also saves the screenshot of the forum news for you. You can find it under the same folder. 

## Steps:
1. Install Python3 (3.7+) to your Linux
2. Install selenium, fake_useragent
```
pip3 install selenium
pip3 install fake_useragent
```
3. Install chrome and chromedriver
* If you are using raspberry pi 4, the default chromium browser is fine. We just need to download [armhf version of chromedriver](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/armhf/chromium-chromedriver/78.0.3904.108-0ubuntu0.16.04.1)
* If you use x86, find the related x86 chromedriver.

2. git pull or download the python file to your desired folder

3. In the same folder, create accounts.json
Fill in your account and password for 1point3acres.com
{
	"account": "",
	"password": ""
}

4. In the same folder, create emails.json
Fill in your account and password for Gmail, and the email address that you want to receive the notification
{
	"senderGmailAccount": "***@gmail.com",
	"senderGmailPass": "",
	"receiver": "***@***.com"
}

5. Open your linux terminal, run "python3 1p3a.py". Test If you receive the email about your forum points.
