# 1p3a_auto_sign / 一亩三分地自动签到脚本
1point3acres.com forum auto sign script

## What you need: 
* Python3
* Chrome && chromedriver
* Selenium
* Linux (Use raspberry pi 4 for demo)

## What it can do for you: 
* Auto sign for you to get one forum point every day
* Send the account summary to your email, give you an idea of how many points you have in total:dog:
* Save the screenshot of the forum news for you. (totally useless but I still did it)
* Keep the logging information in example.log under the same folder. If there is errors or exceptions, you can check it here

## Steps:
1. Install Python3 (3.7+) to your Linux
2. Install selenium, fake_useragent
```python
pip3 install selenium
pip3 install fake_useragent
```
3. Install chrome and chromedriver
* If you are using raspberry pi 4, the default chromium browser is fine. We just need to download [armhf version of chromedriver](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/armhf/chromium-chromedriver/78.0.3904.108-0ubuntu0.16.04.1).
* If you are using x86 Linux, first download [chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/), second find the related [x86 version of chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
4. Download the project
```
git clone https://github.com/minweny/1p3a_auto_sign.git
```
Your folder starts with one python file
<br>![start](start.png)<br>
5. In the same folder, create accounts.json
<br>Fill in your 1point3acres.com account and password
```json
[
	{
		"account": "",
		"password": ""
	}
]
```
6. In the same folder, create email.json
<br>Fill in your account and password for Gmail, and the email address that you want to receive the notification.
<br>Note: You may need to disable some security settings in Gmail
```json
{
	"senderGmailAccount": "***@gmail.com",
	"senderGmailPass": "",
	"receiver": "***@***.com"
}
```
After step 5 and 6, you would have:

```
Test If you have received the email about your forum points.

Add following setences

# execute the python script every 6 hours
